Server Farmer is a lightweight framework designed for companies, that manage
many servers and services belonging to many different customers, but connected
into a single managed platform.

As of 2016, Server Farmer has over 8 years of history of managing, production
servers (which is longer than in competing Chef framework), including over
1 year of being successful open source project. It was used to manage the
infrastructure for over 100 customers, consisted of over 400 physical/virtual
servers, and OpenVZ containers, located in multiple data centers, in almost
10 major cities in Poland, and at least 1 city in Germany.

## Advantages of Server Farmer over manual server management

No matter if you manage just a single server, or hundreds of them, installing
Server Farmer gives you many advantages over default OS configuration:

- consistent and reliable tools to manage many servers at once (or one by one)
- several monitoring capabilities
- automatic, possibly encrypted backups
- working MTA configuration (your servers are now able to send emails)
- central logging configuration (all logs are stored and processed in one place, enhancing security of your infrastructure)
- more secure configurations of several system components (depending on OS version)

## Advantages of Server Farmer over competitive tools

There are many similar solutions: Puppet, Chef, Ansible, cfengine are the most
popular ones. What they have in common is that all of them:

- require much more resources just to be run
- utilize much more resources to handle typical tasks
- have way more steep learning curve
- are way more expensive to set up and use

Server Farmer basic configuration can be set up just in a few minutes and then
extended, when your server farm is growing. You can also implement your own
functional extensions (just like Ansible playbooks or Chef recipes, but much
more simple), that will cover completely new functionalities.

Server Farmer is the ideal tool to manage customers, who have 1-3 servers each
(up to let's say 1-20 servers), where most of such servers run well-known
applications and their configuration is similar to each other and close to
OS defaults where possible.

## How to install Server Farmer on your first server

([see the full manual](http://serverfarmer.org/getting-started.html))

- fork this repository
- clone it to your server, exactly to the /opt/farm directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-github-login/serverfarmer /opt/farm
```

- customize it (and commit your changes into repository, if you want to reuse them on more servers):

```
cd /opt/farm
vi scripts/functions.custom
git add scripts/functions.custom
git ci
git push
```

- begin setup and just follow the simple on-screen instructions:

```
/opt/farm/setup.sh
```

## How to deploy Server Farmer into Amazon cloud

([see the full manual](http://serverfarmer.org/cloud-integration.html))

- install awscli and configure your account details
- install Cloud Farmer and configure it:

```
git clone https://github.com/serverfarmer/cloudfarmer /opt/cloud
vi /opt/cloud/credentials/variables.sh
vi /opt/cloud/credentials/ec2.sh
```

- create a new EC2 instance:

```
/opt/cloud/providers/ec2/ec2-create-simple.sh aws-test-key1 m4.xlarge
```

- deploy Server Farmer on it:

```
/opt/cloud/deploy.sh ec2-hostname.compute.amazonaws.com /path/to/initial/ssh.key
```
